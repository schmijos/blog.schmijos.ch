In spring 2008 I bought my cute little netbook. I paid about 600 Swiss Francs for it. 
It was delivered with MS Windows XP on a 120GB harddisk and 1GB RAM. 
From then on I carried 1.5kg instead of the 3.5kg of my HP Laptop. 
I use it for all my work except visual design. Even Eclipse is running 
stable and fast on it. After 2.5 years of service, the harddisk began to clicker. 
I exchanged it with a 600GB one. But that one was too slow, and I exchanged it 
with an 60GB SSD. In the same occasion I upgraded my RAM to 2GB.

After all I can say that the Asus netbook was my best investment ever! 
It fell to the ground x times. People walked over it. Sharp things scratched 
its surface, but it’s still running perfectly with a battery lifetime of 
approximately 5 hours.

A big compliment to Asus for the Asus EeePC 1000HE!
