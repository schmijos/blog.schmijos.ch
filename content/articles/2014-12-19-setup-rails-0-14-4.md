Sometimes it’s interesting to have a look at how things evolved over time.
Today I set up a rails 0.14.4 application (discontinued in 2005) to have a
look at the feature scope of it. I was surprised how easy that was. The most 
complicated part was to compile ruby 1.8.7 on my Mac since old ruby versions 
can’t be compiled with llvm-gcc (keyword: brew install apple-gcc42).

    mkdir try_old_rails
    cd try_old_rails
    rbenv install 1.8.7-p375
    rbenv local 1.8.7-p375

Since we have bundler today I’m not going to do all the work by myself but instead 
create a Gemfile. The contents are:

    source 'https://rubygems.org'
    ruby '1.8.7'
    gem 'rails', '0.14.4'

Then I’m going to install bundler and rails.

    gem install bundler
    bundle install

The rails application itself has to be created differently than today. 
Also rails s is not working yet. But everything is already well prepared.

    rails ./
    ruby script/server

Now you can got to http://localhost:3000 and you should see the follwing.
