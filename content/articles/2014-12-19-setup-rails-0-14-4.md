Sometimes it's interesting to have a look at how things evolved over time. Today I set up a _rails 0.14.4_ application (discontinued in 2005) to have a look at the feature scope of it. I was surprised how easy that was. The most complicated part was to compile _ruby 1.8.7_ on my Mac since old ruby versions can't be compiled with _llvm-gcc_ (keyword: `brew install apple-gcc42`). 

[bash]
mkdir try_old_rails
cd try_old_rails
rbenv install 1.8.7-p375
rbenv local 1.8.7-p375
[/bash]

Since we have _bundler_ today I'm **not** going to do all the work by myself but instead create a `Gemfile`. The contents are:

[ruby]
source 'https://rubygems.org'
ruby '1.8.7'
gem 'rails', '0.14.4'
[/ruby]

Then I'm going to install _bundler_ and _rails_.

[bash]
gem install bundler
bundle install
[/bash]

The _rails_ application itself has to be created differently than today. Also `rails s` is not working yet. But everything is already well prepared.

[bash]
rails ./
ruby script/server
[/bash]

Now you can got to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the follwing.
