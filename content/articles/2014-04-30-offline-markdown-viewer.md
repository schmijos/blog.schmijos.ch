If you’re searching for a slim offline Markdown viewer for windows there’s hope. 
There’s already [Markdown Pad 2](/web/20141203055943/http://markdownpad.com/ "Markdown Pad 2") 
but it’s bloated. I found the binary executable of the predecessor 
here: [Markdown Pad 1.1](/web/20141203055943/http://apps.codigobit.info/2012/06/markdown-pad-markdown-textfile-editor.html "Markdown Pad 1.1"). 
The old version neighter needs the C++ Redistributable nor admin rights. It’s not 
bloated and starts amazingly fast.

Since not everybody has access to dropbox, here’s another download link to the 
executable: [MDPad.v1.1 (467kb)](files/MDPad.v1.1.zip)
