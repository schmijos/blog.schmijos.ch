If you're searching for a slim offline Markdown viewer for windows there's hope. There's already [Markdown Pad 2](http://markdownpad.com/) but it's bloated. I found the binary executable of the predecessor here: [Markdown Pad 1.1](http://apps.codigobit.info/2012/06/markdown-pad-markdown-textfile-editor.html). The old version neighter needs the C++ Redistributable nor admin rights. It's not bloated and starts amazingly fast.

Since not everybody has access to dropbox, here's another download link to the executable: [MDPad.v1.1 (467kb)](/files/MDPad.v1.1.zip)
